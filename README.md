## Quadrillion from Smart Games Brief description of your project topic(the real one)

Single player board puzzle game that consists of 4 grids and 12 pieces. Objective of the game is to fill the grids with pieces so that there is no empty spaces left except for the forbidden spaces set out by the grid. 

## Brief description of what you will do, your requirements( NO IDEA)

## Differences from the original game
2D instead of 3D, timer, high score, obviously desktop application instead of board game (dnno?)
